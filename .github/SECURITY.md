## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please use GitHub private vulnerability reporting (Security Advisories) for responsible disclosure.

If private reporting is not available, open an issue without exploit details and request a private contact channel.

When reporting, include:

- Reproduction steps
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Any relevant logs or runbook snippets with secrets removed

We will acknowledge reports as quickly as possible and provide remediation status updates.
